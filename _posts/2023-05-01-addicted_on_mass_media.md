The most effective ways to get people high on dopamine are alive and well on public monitors.
The most effective ways to addict humans have survived and are now on our screens.

Netflix, YouTube videos, TikTok, short, stimulating drugs and A/B testing endlessly
Showing some people screen A and others screen B.
If B has a higher dwell time and people are choosing B more, you ditch A and go into the B pipeline.

We're constantly creating different strategies and competing against each other to figure out how to get people to stay in the app longer and see our ads.
This R&D is done by psychologists, engineers, and marketing strategists working together, so the average person who's addicted can't get away with it.
Rather than a food company mixing flavors together to create a delicious and very addictive food that the average person can't resist, it's a processed food.

These videos on YouTube, Netflix, etc. are more like synthetic drugs that can produce a faster dopamine rush.
Our bodies have an intrinsic opiate link, and when we are stimulated by new things, we release reward hormones.
In the past, exploration, adventure, and going into unknown territory were dopamine stimuli for people.
but in modern society, we've taken these stimuli to extremes.  

Uncertainty Curiosity about the unknown 
When you see a thumbnail, you can't help but click on it, not knowing what you're going to see next.
The dopamine rush of uncertainty. 
If you look at people who have taken fentanyl, they're so addicted to it that they can't get off of it.
In Philadelphia, there's a street called Kensington, where drug addicts walk around like zombies. 
Many fentanyl addicts roam the streets unable to control themselves. 

Fentanyl addicts' dopamine systems are completely destroyed and it takes decades to recover.
That's because once a synthetic drug causes an overwhelming stimulus, humans and animals gradually reduce the amount of stimulation
to protect their brains, so the remaining natural stimuli become much less rewarding. 
Sometimes so much so that we don't even feel it.

So when you're addicted to drugs or alcohol, normal everyday life feels like black and white and you don't feel anything.
If you are constantly exposed to YouTube videos, Netflix, Shorts, TikTok, etc.
You become a person who has difficulty focusing on normal stimuli, and you become nervous about everyday stimuli with low rewards.
In digital drug videos, time passes quickly, from tens of seconds to just a few minutes. 
The natural passage of time in everyday life is slowed down. As a result, the person becomes bored with routine and loses the sense of spontaneity in ordinary things.

Moreover, the shorter the happiness of those addicted to digital drugs, the harder it is for them to finish a long video or movie on YouTube, so they skip it or watch other videos along the way.
This is mostly seen in TikTok addicts, Short Story addicts, and people who have become severely addicted. 
It's an addiction that's so powerful that even the most extreme of human beings can't get off of it once they've taken a shot of fentanyl. 
If you're already addicted to digital drugs, you can't wean yourself off of them gradually, you have to wean yourself off of them once and for all. 

And it will take a significant amount of time before you can get the dopamine from normal activities, from everyday life. 
The way to quit is to immerse yourself in another hobby or practice meditation or yoga instead of watching digital videos.
Meditation and yoga allow you to block out external stimuli and observe the impulse to act from within.
They restore mental balance and restore the body's rhythm, making digital addicts self-regenerating.
The digital stimuli in the world are getting stronger and more intense. 
If we don't protect ourselves from these stimuli, we can end up behaving like zombies, like the addicts on the streets of Kensington.
