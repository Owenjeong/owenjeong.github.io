-- ANY and ALL : to perform a comparison between a single column vaue and a range of other values.
-- Any means at least one value has to match. All means all values have to match.
-- The keyword IN can also be used instead of ANY or ALL.
-- it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10

-- CASE : expression goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met(like an if-then-else statement).
-- so, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. if no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
-- it will add a column for the result.
